# booknook 📚

A simple Flask web application to track and record the books you've read.

Who is this app for?  
 - Primarily aimed at self-hosting book lovers who want a private, secure way to log their reading history without relying on third-party services.
Should you self host this app please know it does not track you in any way, shape or form.  No analytics, no ads, no tracking scripts. Just you and your books.

## Features

- ✅ Add books you've read with title, author, and date
- 🔍 **Auto-lookup book info from ISBN** - Automatically fetch title, author, and genre using Open Library API
- 🖼️ **Book covers** - Display cover images from Open Library with automatic ISBN lookup
- 📖 **Multiple formats** - Track physical books, ebooks, and audiobooks
- ⭐ Rate books on a 1-5 star scale
- 🏷️ **Genre/categories** - Organize books by genre
- 📝 Add personal notes and thoughts about each book
- ✏️ Edit book entries
- 🗑️ Delete books from your collection
- 📊 View all your books in a beautiful grid layout
- 📚 **To-Be-Read (TBR) tracking** - Organize books into "To Read", "Currently Reading", and "Read" statuses
- 🔐 **Password-less account recovery** - Recover accounts using recovery codes (no email required)
- 🔒 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** - Optional TOTP-based 2FA for enhanced security
- ⚙️ **Account settings** - Change email address with password verification
- 🎨 **Warm library aesthetic** - Cosy, literary-inspired design with warm browns and serif typography
- ♿ **Accessible design** - WCAG AA/AAA compliant color contrast and responsive layouts

## Installation

This application **requires Docker and Docker Compose**. All other setup is handled automatically by the container.
### Development (Contributors)

1. **Clone the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pagyP/booknook.git
   cd booknook
   ```

2. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI and SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. **Start the application (builds from local Dockerfile):**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Production (Users)

5. **Database Setup:**
   
   The application uses PostgreSQL. For local development, the easiest option is to use Docker:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d db
   ```
   
   Or configure a local PostgreSQL instance and add to your `.env`:
   ```bash
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgresql+psycopg://username:password@localhost:5432/booknook
   ```
   
   **Note:** PostgreSQL is required for all environments. There is no SQLite fallback.

## Running the Application
For users who want to run the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry:

1. **Create environment file:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env with your database configuration
   DB_USER=booknook
   DB_PASSWORD=<change-to-secure-password>
   DB_NAME=booknook
   SECRET_KEY=<generate-with-python>
   FLASK_ENV=production
   SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
   ```

2. **Start the application (uses pre-built image):**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
   
   **Note:** The development server runs on port 5000 by default. When using Docker (production), the app runs on port 8000 via Gunicorn.
3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

**Note:** Database schema is created automatically on startup via `init_db.py`. If you're upgrading from a version created before the MFA feature, see [DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md](DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md) for schema migration instructions.

For detailed Docker and production deployment instructions, see [DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md](DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Security Features

✅ **User Authentication** - Create accounts with secure password hashing  
✅ **Password Hashing** - Passwords hashed using Argon2 (memory-hard, GPU-resistant)  
✅ **Multi-Factor Authentication** - Optional TOTP-based 2FA using authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)  
✅ **Trusted Devices** - Mark devices as trusted for 30 days to reduce MFA prompts  
✅ **Account Recovery** - Recover lost passwords using single-use recovery codes (no email required)  
✅ **Session Management** - Secure session handling with Flask-Login and 24-hour persistent timeout  
✅ **CSRF Protection** - All forms protected with CSRF tokens via Flask-WTF  
✅ **Data Isolation** - Users can only see and edit their own books  
✅ **Environment Variables** - Secret key stored in .env (not committed to git)  
✅ **Form Validation** - Email format and password confirmation validation  
✅ **Rate Limiting** - Login attempts limited to 5 per minute to prevent brute force; email changes limited to 10 per hour  
✅ **Security Logging** - All authentication events logged for audit trail  
✅ **Email Security** - Email display on signup prevents user lockout from typos; settings page allows secure email changes with password verification  
✅ **Accessibility** - WCAG AA/AAA color contrast standards for inclusive design (7:1+ contrast ratios)
