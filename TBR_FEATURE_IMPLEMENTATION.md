## 🎨 Visual Indicators

**Book Card Badges:**
- 📚 **To Read** (Yellow) - Books on your TBR list
- 📖 **Currently Reading** (Light Blue) - Books you're reading now
- ✓ **Read** (Light Green) - Completed books

---

## 📊 API Usage

Filter using URL query parameters:

```
https://yourapp.com/?status=to_read           # Show To Read books
https://yourapp.com/?status=currently_reading  # Show Currently Reading
https://yourapp.com/?status=read              # Show Read books
https://yourapp.com/?search=fiction&status=to_read   # Search + Filter
https://yourapp.com/?                         # Show All books (default)
```

## 💾 Database Migration

### Fresh Database Setup (New Deployments)

For **new deployments with no existing data**:

1. `db.create_all()` in `init_db.py` automatically creates the `books` table with the `status` column
2. All existing books will have `status = 'read'` by default
3. No manual migration steps needed
4. Database is ready immediately

### Existing Database Setup (Migration Required)

⚠️ **Important**: `db.create_all()` **only creates tables that don't exist**. It **does NOT alter existing tables** to add new columns.

If you deploy this change to an existing application with a database:
- The `status` column will NOT be created automatically
- The app will fail with: `psycopg.errors.UndefinedColumn: column "book"."status" does not exist`
- You **MUST** manually add the column using one of the options below

### Deployment: Keeping Existing Data

For **production deployments** where you want to preserve existing data without recreating the database:

**Option 1: Clean Restart (if downtime is acceptable)**
```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up
```
This removes the old database and creates a new one with the correct schema. All previous data will be lost.

**Option 2: Zero-Downtime Migration (recommended for production)**

Add the `status` column to the existing PostgreSQL database without losing data:

```bash
docker exec booknook_db psql -U booknook -d booknook -c "ALTER TABLE book ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'read';"
docker compose restart booknook_app
```

This approach:
- ✅ Keeps all existing book data intact
- ✅ Assigns `'read'` status to all existing books
- ✅ Minimizes downtime (only app restart needed)
- ✅ Safe to run on production

Or run the app normally - `db.create_all()` will create the new schema on startup.

## ✅ Testing Your Feature

### Quick Manual Tests
1. **Add a TBR book** → Select "To Read" status → Verify it saves
2. **Filter by status** → Click "📚 To Read" → See only TBR books
3. **Edit a book** → Change status → Verify update
4. **Search in TBR** → Search + filter → Both work together
5. **Stats update** → Watch numbers change when you filter

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Existing books default to "Read" status
- ✅ All existing functionality still works
- ✅ No breaking changes

---

## 📝 Files Modified

- `app.py` - Core backend implementation
- `templates/index.html` - Home page with filter UI
- `templates/add_book.html` - Add book form with status field
- `templates/edit_book.html` - Edit book form with status field

---

## 🎯 What's Next (Optional Ideas)

If you want to enhance the feature further, consider:

1. **Quick status buttons** on book cards (change status without editing)
2. **Reading statistics** - How many books in each status?
3. **Date tracking** - When did you start/finish each book?
4. **TBR organization** - Sort by priority or reading order
5. **Statistics dashboard** - Books per month, reading velocity, etc.
6. **Export TBR list** - Share your reading list with friends

---

## 💡 Notes

- Status is **required** when adding/editing books (can't be empty)
- Status is **case-sensitive** in URLs but form handles it safely
- The filter dropdown is responsive and works great on mobile
- All existing security features still apply to status filtering

Enjoy organizing your reading! 📚
